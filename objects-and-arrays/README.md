###[ARRAYS] (http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_arrays.asp)

Arrays store multiple values and data types on one variable

**Creating an Array** 

var cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW", 3, 4, 5];

Var cars = new array("Saab", "Volvo", "BMW", 3, 4, 5);

**Accessing Data from an Array (parse)**

cars[0] evaluates to "Saab"

cars[1] evaluates to "Volvo"

###[Objects] (http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_objects.asp)

Objects store values, called properties, of an object and can store methods (functions) that an oject can perform.  

**Creating Objects**

var person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue"};

**Accessing Values from an Object**

name = person.lastName; evaluates to "Doe"

name = person["lastName"]; evaluates to "Doe"
